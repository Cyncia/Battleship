# Battleship
My first repository

Project 3 for CS 32 at UCLA. 

For this project, I had to complete a battle ship game in C++ that consists of four different player types and three different game modes. For each player, there exists a board that is private to him/her only. The game requires that all players to place all existing ships onto their respective board before starting. Once all ships are placed, the game begins with one player attacking a cell on his/her's opponent's board. Each player alternates when attacking regardless of hit or miss. Two display boards are produced during each turn - one displays the opponent's board before any attack has occurred and the other after an attack. Instructions and statuses are 

The four player types are:
  1. Awful Player - Only places ships horizontally
  2. Mediocre Player
  3. Good Player
  4. Human Player

There are three different game modes to choose from:
  1. A mini-game between two mediocre players
  2. A mediocre player against a human player
  3. A 10-game consecutive match between a mediocre and an awful player
